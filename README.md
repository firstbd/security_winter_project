## 📂 Project Overview

### 🔐 CTF Challenge Creation
I create my own CTF challenges to understand problems from the **author’s perspective**.

Topics include:
- Reverse Engineering (key verification, obfuscation)
- Cryptography (intentionally weak designs)

Each challenge includes:
- Challenge binary / source
- Problem description
- Author write-up

### 🧬 WannaCry Ransomware Analysis
- Focus on **encryption logic only**
- Hybrid encryption (AES + RSA)
- Clean-room reimplementation for educational purposes
- No malware distribution or propagation logic

## 📅 Roadmap

- **January**
  - Easy reversing challenge
  - GitHub setup & documentation
- **February**
  - Hard reversing + crypto challenge
  - WannaCry encryption deep dive
- **March**
  - Documentation polish
  - Portfolio-ready cleanup
All projects are for **educational purposes only**.  
No malicious intent or real-world attack usage is involved.
